## My process 💻

### Built with 🛠️

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Initial Template React
- [React](https://pt-br.react.dev/) - JS library
- [React Router DOM](https://nextjs.org/) - React library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned 📚

With this project, I was able to significantly improve my CSS skills, including the use of Tailwind, a framework that proved extremely interesting for allowing the application of styles directly to HTML classes. In addition, I used the React Router library to define the project routes, learning how to work with states in React, which helped me become even more familiar with this technology in general.

### Continued development 🚀

I want to continue studying React and create amazing projects in the future. This is just the beginning; In the future, I plan to complete my portfolio using this amazing library!
